         <h2>How and Why to Validate Code</h2>
         <p>I learned in the begining of the course that it is important to
            check your markup through some third party websites. For example,
            the book had us use the W3C <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML</a>
            and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS</a> code validators.</p>

         <p>Similarly, it is important check your website in a browser often and
            make sure that it has the appearance that you want. And, perhaps
            <span class="highlight"><strong>more importantly</strong></span>, to regularly check
            your site, all of its pages, and all of its features in several of
            the most popular web browsers as different browsers interpret
            instructions differently.</p>

         <p id="noIndent">
            In desktops, the most used browsers according to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_tables"
               target="_blank">Wikipedia.com</a>:
            <ul>
               <li><span class="highlight">Go</span>ogle Chrome</li>
               <li>Internet <span class="highlight">Explore</span>r</li>
               <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
               <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
               <li>Safari</li>
            </ul>

         <h2>How and Why to Use CSS</h2>
         <p>In this course I also learned how to <span class="highlight">style</span>
            different elements in a website. Aside from the built in HTML elements
            such as <em>emphasis</em> and <strong>strong</strong>, I've learned how
            to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"
            target="_blank"> Cascading Style Sheets</a> to make my webpages look better
            than they would without.</p>
         <p>On <span class="highlight">top</span> of styling, I've learned of the
            three different ways to utilize CSS. For instance, for a limitted amount of
            CSS on a single webpage, and embedded stylesheet would be apt to handle the
            amount of styling required. For someone just learning, inline styling my be
            best as that would allow for better association amongst the elements.
            And for a large multipage website, a combination of embedded and external
            stylesheets would be <span class="highlight">optimal</span>.</p>
      </section><!-- end CSS section-->
      <section><!-- Begin Layout section -->
         <h2>About Liquid and Fixed-Width Layouts</h2>
         <p>On a more advanced <span class="highlight">note</span>, I learned about
            making different types of layouts. A Fixed-Width Layout is on which
            stays the same width.
            Often times, this means that the widths, paddings, and margins all have
            specific values represented in pixels.</p>
         <p>Also, one could use a Liquid Layout (<span class="highlight">this website</span>).
            In this type of layout, widths, paddings, and margins are typically represented with percents.
            Using a percent to describe the desired width of something in CSS means to take
            that <span class="highlight">percentage</span> of the element in which the
            one being styled is nested.</p>
